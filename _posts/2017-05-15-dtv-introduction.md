*Distant Viewing TV* is a new project that uses and develops computational
techniques to analyze moving image culture on a large scale.
The project includes the development of an open source toolkit for
extracting time-coded metadata from moving images and associated audio
data. Using these tools, the project analyzes how visual space is
used by characters over a set of fourteen sitcoms from the
Network Era of American Television (1952-1985), modeling a
new mode of cultural analysis. It is currently in active development.
More information about the project as a whole can be found on the
website [distanttv.org](https://distanttv.org).

I will be producing blog posts on this site as a means for documenting
the processing of building these tools and analyzing our initial corpus
for *Distant Viewing TV*. We feel that too many projects
focus only on the final outcomes, making the process of applied data analysis
seem either inaccessible and almost like magic or straightforward and trivial.
**The truth is that even experts in the field spend hundreds of hours trying
a multitude of approaches only to find that the majority of them do not work.**
We hope that these informal, stream-of-consciousness style pieces documenting
the entire process will help to make this more clear.

Currently, the following posts are available. I will update the list as the
project progresses.

- [Distant Viewing TV: Extract Images](../dtv-extract-images)
- [Distant Viewing TV: Face Detection with OpenFace](../dtv-face-detection)
- [Distant Viewing TV: Shot Detection](../dtv-shot-detection)
- [Distant Viewing TV: Initial Training Set](../dtv-first-training-set)

As these pieces focus on the computational aspects of the project they are
primarily written by myself in collaboration with [Lauren Tilton](https://laurentilton.com),
the project's co-PI. The larger project would not
be possible without the rest of the project's core team: Annie Berke,
Claudia Calhoun, and Nate Ayers. The Distant Viewing TV team is completed
by a fantastic advisory board, consisting of:

- Paul Achter, University of Richmond
- Joel Burges, University of Rochester
- Jeremy Butler, University of Alabama
- Lev Manovich, The Graduate Center at CUNY
- Trevor Mu√±oz, Univesity of Maryland
- Miriam Posner, UCLA
- Joshua Romphf, University of Rochester
- Holly Rushmeier, Yale University
- Mark Williams, Dartmouth College

We are also grateful for the institutional support of the project through
the University of Richmond's Digital Scholarship Lab. Over time, we expect
to produce peer-reviewed scholarship in partnership with our team members
and advisors.
